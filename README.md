# Early-detection-of-Pancreatic-Cancer
Abstract â€“ Pancreatic cancer is the seventh leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide and is often diagnosed at advanced stage, resulting in one of the lowest survival rates, necessitating early detection for improved patient outcome and save lives. Despite the ongoing advancements, there is a pressing need for more extensive research and data collection to enhance the predictive capabilities of Machine Learning models for pancreatic cancer in India. The objective of our research is to develop a robust machine learning model that can assist healthcare providers in identifying early life high risk-pancreatic cancer so preventive efforts can be immediately put in action. By employing a diverse array of algorithms such as Random Forest, Extra Trees, XGBoost, LightGBM, we aim to optimize prediction accuracy and uncover novel insights into the disease. The Extra Trees model emerged as the best-performing model in our experiments, both in terms of validation and test results.
